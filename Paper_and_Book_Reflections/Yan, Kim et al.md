Is there a better way to choose a library to use as a software developer, than to look in an ad hoc manner?

Programmers need to find libraries to use in their code, but lack a way to compare libraries directly based on the code required of a programmer who uses those libraries. As a result, library selection may not be optimal. As evidence, the authors cite the current de facto way programmers compare libraries and the existence of several library selection websites.

The authors create a system where many concept-annotated code examples from different libraries are rendered side-by-side. They designed and implemented ParaLib as a technical probe and evaluated it in a within-subjects user study with 20 participants. The study suggested that the availablity of concept-annotated code examples did assist programmers in the choice of what libraries to use. 

Online library comparison websites such as StackShare help users find libraries, but rarely include concrete code examples. Compared to tools that focus on supporting usersâ€™ annotation and evaluation of APIs, such as Unakite and Strata, ParaLib displays many code examples to help the user compare different libraries.
