This paper concerns an Augmented Reality-based guidance system that helps users take time-lapse videos without needing to manually remember the angle of each frame (picture) in the timelapse.

Photographers and people who casually wish to make timelapses without specialized training or equipment often struggle to make good looking timelapses when frames do not match up in position or perspective. Evidence comes both from common sense and from the user study the authors conducted. 

The authors created an app, ReCapture, that leverages Augmented Reality (AR)-based guidance to help users repeatedly photograph subjects from consistent viewpoints over time, allowing users can build time-lapse video frame-by-frame with common hand-held devices. The effectiveness of this approach was confirmed through a user study. 

Related work includes work on computational re-photography, re-capturing previously recorded images of a scene. One implementation by Shih et al. required the use of a cart, which ReCapture does not need. Bae et al. used computational re-photography to recapture historical photos, but their system is not hand-held, and only addresses single-image capture.
