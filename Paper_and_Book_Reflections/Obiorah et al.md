Museum curators and organizers may like to take advantage of citizen science and collaboration to engage visitors in people-powered research and support collaborative discussions around scientifc ideas, but may not have the tools to make the process efficient or effective. As evidence, the authors cite other, earlier efforts, and also conducted a series of preliminary studies with their target planetarium.

The authors created U!Scientist, an interactive multi-person tabletop exhibit based on the online Zooniverse project, Galaxy Zoo, and installed it in a planetarium. The effectiveness of U!Scientist was measured through video, computer logs, naturalistic observations, and surveys with visitors.

A related work is Galaxy Zoo, which inspired the authors, but U!Scientist has a greater focus on direct interaction between users and getting volunteers to collaborate. A non-technical but museum-related concept is Active Prolonged Engagement, which the authors used as inspiration.
