Scientists who create and analyze visualization systems use visualization models for guidance, but may not know how to evaluate their visualization systems. While they may know how these systems can be created, they may not know which system to create for the greatest effect. As evidence for this need, the author cites dissatisfaction with a flat list of evaluation methodologies in her own paper ("Process and pitfalls in writing infovis research papers"), because it lacked a framework guiding the decision process. 

The approach the author takes in this paper is to present a model splitting visualization design into a four-level nested model, from a top-level characterization of the problems and data, to the bottom level of creating an algorithm to carry out a design to visually encode data automatically and efficiently. The author then applies her model to various genealogical graphs, flow maps, social network analysis, and system management time-series data, to evaluate it. 

Other similar models include visualization and pipeline models, which the author says greatly inspired her in creating her own model. These previous models did not include guidance on evluation methodology, or how to couple design and evaluation. Tory and MÃ¶ller work addresses some of this, but Munzner's work is broader in scope. Other work on evaluating visualization mostly focussed on how to use methods to evaluate visualization instead of on when to use them. Kosara's article discusses when to use them, but does not include a formal framework.

Munzner's model is simple and easy to comprehend and to keep in mind for scientists, but there are times when it appears that she errs on the side of over-simplification. Alternatively, visualization designers could also first set up requirements, then generate multiple solutions and pick the best solution.
