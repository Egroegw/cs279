Social scientists and anthropologists may want to understand the cultural factors that influence people’s choices and the
overall outcome in a group decision-making process, but may not have considered social norms and values when it comes to finding a time to meet.

The authors analyzed 1,771,430 anonymized date/time polls provided by Doodle from 2011 and 2012. They conclude, based on analysis they conduct, that culture influences how we schedule events online. 

The authors suggest that their analysis of Doodle date/time polls was an empirically powerful way to unobtrusively investigate such variations between countries, but concede that interviews and surveys to follow up would strengthen their conclusions. Related anthropological work include cultural dimensions and Hofstede’s Individualism/Collectivism dimension.
