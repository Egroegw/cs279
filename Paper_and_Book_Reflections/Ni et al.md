# Ni et al

Software engineers and developers often need to refactor and transform code, but tools that assist in this goal often require too much expertise or effort to be able to use effectively. The evidence provided by the authors is from formative interviews with developers.

The authors created a system, Recode, which enhances the regular find-and-replace experience by allowing the developer to specify a straightforward search term to identify relevant locations, and then demonstrate their intended changes by simply typing a change directly in the editor. The effectiveness of Recode was evaluated through a 12-person user study. 

A related, earlier piece of work, BluePencil, passively detects and presents code transformation suggestions, but but ReCode better supports developers who frequently desire to have more control over their code transformations. The authors do not include any other similar systems.
