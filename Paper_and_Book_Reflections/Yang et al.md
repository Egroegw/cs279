Designers, researchers, and design tool makers want to create valuable Human-AI interactions, but face challenges in designing and innovating strong systems. Evidence is drawn from prior research in this area. 

To help arm stakeholders with tools that assist them in creating systems with many useful Human-AI interactions, the authors create a framework that articulating the challenges of human-AI interaction. The effectiveness of this framwork was evaluated through presenting the paper to about 40 HCI researchers and to 12 machine learning
researchers.

Related work has focused on challenges faced by UX practitioners who do not specialize in AI but who desire to integrate it into their practice, but is incomplete and does not only focus on human-AI interaction.
