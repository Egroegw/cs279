# Hempel et al

Programmers who work on presentation and document preparation as well programmers who work on specialized creative tasks (engineering and graphic design) often face the choice of whether to use a  direct manipulation GUI that may not allow convenient code manipulation, or a code editor without a GUI and that might hence sacrifice ergonomics. These users would like to draw shapes and other objects, but are faced with this dilemma.

The authors did not directly provide direct evidence that some programmers have this need and obstacle, although they provide indirect evidence by referencing other work that previously tried to address this need and that create a output-directed programming paradigm.

The approach the authors use is to create a program, Sketch-n-sketch, with a GUI that allows users to both manipulate code and to draw and edit shapes using a point-and-click mouse system. Code written is shown graphically, while shapes created immediately add to the code. Shapes can be drawn, designs abstracted, and refactored. As evidence, the authors use a case study where they attempted to implement a dozen new parametric designs without needing to manipulate code. 

The novelty of the program as compared to an earlier version is that users can manipulate immediate execution values, focus expressions, and use generic refactoring tools and generic run-time tracing. An example of a different approach, recording user actions as
a series of steps that together act as a program, is EBP. A system that allows for constraint specification, Apparatus, does not represent the design in a general-purpose, text-based programming language.
