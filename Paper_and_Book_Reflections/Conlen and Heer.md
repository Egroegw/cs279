# Conlen and Heer

Publishers and editors of web content may want to include interactive media to better communicate complex ideas, but may lack the expertise or time or finances to produce interactive media. The evidence the authors provide are from industry experience and interviews with domain experts.

The approach the authors use is to contribute design tools to make it easier to author and publish interactive articles, and in particular, Idyll, a “compile-to-the-web” language for web-based interactive narratives. The effectiveness of Idyll was demonstrated through a user study involving undergraduates. 

In 2010, Segel and Heer articulated a design space of narrative visualization, but the tools and techniques used by practitioners are constantly shifting. Flapjax is a language that brings functional reactive programming to the web, showing that event-driven reactivity is a good fit for web applications.
