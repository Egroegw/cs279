Artificial Intelligence experts and advocates of programming by demonstration would like ordinary users of computers to be able to create programs by demonstrating what their programs should do, without needing to learn programming languages. However, an obstacle faced is that it is very difficult for a system to successfully guess the user’s intended program out of an infinite space of possible programs. The author provides evidence in the form of citations of earlier research.

The author presents case studies of three programming by demonstration systems, namely SMARTedit, Sheepdog, and CoScripter. She summarizes the user feedback researches collected into a few big ideas, such as to detect failure and fail gracefully, make it easy to correct the system, and encourage trust by presenting a model users can understand. The evidence is based on researchers’ experience with several machine-learning-based programming by demonstration systems.

The author does not talk about any work similar to her summary.
