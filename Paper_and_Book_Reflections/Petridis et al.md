Designers and writers would like to have recourse to symbols on demand, but novices may struggle with brainstorm multiple, diverse symbols after sticking to one idea. Consequently, Google Images is  a common resource used for inspiration. The evidence the authors use was from a formative user study with five participants.

The authors created SymbolFinder, an interactive tool for finding visual symbols for abstract concepts. It creates clusters of words for the user, and users can then find related, concrete objects that symbolize the desired concept. The authors conducted a user study and found that SymbolFinder required significantly less mental demand and effort than Google, that participants found significantly more unique symbols with SymbolFinder than with Google, and that SymbolFinder helped participants most when it encouraged multi-faceted interpretation of concepts.

Related tools for sensemaking, like Apolo and Vigor, do not work directly with images and symbols. ICONATE is a system that automatically generates compound icons, but SymbolFinder enables users to conduct their own search, giving users more agency.
