Bus riders want to use realtime predictions of when a bus may arrive in order to check whether they have time to do optional tasks while waiting for a vehicle to arrive. However, users may struggle to comprehend the uncertainty in each estimate and may also miss out on doing tasks or miss a vehicle entirely. As evidence, the authors conducted a survey of 172 OneBusAway users to identify how transit app users currently use realtime vehicle arrival predictions. As evidence, the authors cite evidence that suggests where uncertainty is displayed to users, the users have greater trust and can make better decisions, for example, in body weight measurements, weather predictions, and remaining range of an electric vehicle. 

It is suggested that by providing some measure of potential error, users are not lulled into a false sense of accuracy. It is further suggested that system designers can take note of the authors' findings.

To address and to better visualize uncertainty for users, the authors developed general and domain-specific design requirements and a description of user needs, and proposed design layouts. As evidence, they conducted a user study of 541 transit application users to identify the effectiveness of different visualizations to assess how well users can judge probabilities from the authors' visualizations. 

The authors found that careful discrete-outcome visualizations of uncertainty can improve probability estimation, and recommend discrete outcome plots with few enough outcomes to takeadvantage of subitizing.
