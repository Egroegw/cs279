Pair Research with Binita

Javascript, extensible but syntax-heavy. She likes that if a user who uses Typescript can have type-safety. Typescript is especially nice when you’re sharing code with other people. She has a pro-Javascript outlook :)
Binita says that Python is her 2nd-favorite language. She doesn’t like the abbreviation of “COL” for color, because they could also mean “column” or something else.
I told Binita about the elevators on the west side of the SEAS building.

I said that I would like to learn (and am currently learning) Rust, as a new language.
I brought up learning Javascript through 279r like somebody learning Swedish through Google Translate.

You can achieve a lot with less lines with code.


Priyanka and Shivesh.
