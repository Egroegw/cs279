People who browse the web may have multiple tabs open to multitask or to gather more information, but face the difficulty of managing and controlling all the tabs, which the authors refer to as "tab overload". Evidence comes from earlier research the authors cite.

The authors created a Chrome extension, Tabs.do, which helps users group their tabs into tasks and then to prioritize and switch tasks fluidly. Tabs.do uses machine learning to suggest tasks for groups of tabs. The authors evaluated the effectiveness of Tabs.do through a field deployment study where twenty participants used Tabs.do with their real-life tasks in the wild.
