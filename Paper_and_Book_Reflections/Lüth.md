This paper considers user interfaces for theorem provers, a tool used by some mathematicians to verify and check proofs, providing a level of certainty and confidence that a human mathematician cannot match.

Mathematicians who need to check proofs would like to use tools and aids to help them with rigor and completeness, but these tools do not have the best designs and user interfaces. Therefore, system designers of theorem provers should be able to design better systems, but lack the expertise. The evidence the author provides comes from their own experience in the area of theorem provers and related work Lüth cites.

The author uses the 'Eight Golden Rules' of interface design to inform his classification of current user interfaces. He provides expertise to readers by reviewing the applicability of design guidelines to theorem provers and by classifying user interfaces to aid comprehension. The author does not provide user-study-derived evidence of the effectiveness of his work in this paper, but he explains his statements with logic for the reader to follow along with. 

As this paper discusses and classifies interfaces, there are no applicable "nearest neighbors" or papers that have also discussed every interface. The author does note that the overall challenge in user interfaces is to leverage the underlying technology to an extent which makes it easier to do proofs in a computer than with pen and paper.
